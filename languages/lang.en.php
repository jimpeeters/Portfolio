You have to type in any food you like and it will tell your daily percentage of nutrition values for 100g of this product. It will also tell you how much vitamins you get and if it&#039;s a source of calcium or iron. You can also type in your weight and see how much you have to run to burn these calories. This was made in 2 weeks. The main reason I made this (very originally named) application was because I love to look at food labels. ';
